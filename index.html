				<p class="editable">In 2007, I graduated from the Ontario College of Art & Design with a focus in painting & drawing.  Since then, I have continued to practice and show my artwork locally and abroad. I also enjoy cultivating spaces for artists to create, connect, collaborate and leverage opportunities through my mentorship, teaching and volunteer work.</p>

				<h2 class="editable">Check out My Art</h2>
				<p class="editable">I explore Southern Ontario and travel abroad at every opportunity.  Each experience of people and place offers new and jarring perspectives which continue to fuel my work.  I work primarily in acrylics, charcoal and pastels, though I also enjoy mixed media, inks, watercolours and sculpture.  I enjoy skewing scale and proportion within my work to give the viewer a sense of dislocated familiarity.</p>
